# Crann-Bethadh
## Wonderfully coloured and warm-fuzzy tails through a veil of glass and clouds

Crann Bethadh is a plugin prototype and features a convolution-based engine, incorporating some saturation processing as well. The plugin is also being oversampled internally, to avoid any harmonics being folded back into the audible frequency spectrum, creating unwanted aliasing.

The plugin has the ability the engulf the audio in a nebula of sound. With increasing intensity, the sound gets saturated, but that saturation is being washed out by the convolution cloud, creating wonderfully coloured and warm-fuzzy tails, all being perceived through a veil of glass and nebula, never sounding harsh or brittle.

This branch is a work in progress. It is strapping a svelte project onto a webview for JUCE's plugin editor to render. I am more ore less followowing Elementary Audio's guidance on how how to implement a choc webview with the JUCE framework.
